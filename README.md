 <h1> About the project</h1>
 <p>The motive of our project virtual mouse is to eliminate the existing physical mouse. It can perform all the actions of a physical mouse through dynamic gestures.In addition to the virtual mouse, it also consists of a voice assistant named proton integrated in it.<p>
 <p>When the virtual mouse is activated, the webcam is opened and the nodes of the hands are using the hand detection module and it is preprocessed. It is then compared with the gestures already present in the gesture library and the necessary action is done on the screen. When the proton is activated it prompts the user for input through voice commands and it performs the commands.</p>
